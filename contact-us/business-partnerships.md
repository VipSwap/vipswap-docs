## Listing on the Exchange <a id="exchange"></a>

### How can I list my token on the exchange?

Anybody can "list" any BEP-20 network token on VipSwap. You don't need to contact us or ask permission. You just need to add liquidity to a liquidity pool - that's it. Traders can then trade your token by entering your token's contract address.
